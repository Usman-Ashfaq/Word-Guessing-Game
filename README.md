# Word-Guessing-Game
This repository contains a Word Guessing Game implemented in C++, showcasing core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project demonstrates the use of classes and objects, dynamic memory allocation (DMA), inheritance, polymorphism (both compile-time and run-time), abstraction, encapsulation, exception handling, and templates.
